## 🔌 API routes (REST-like, simple)

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| /api/auth.php | POST | Login/Logout |
| /api/account.php | GET/POST | Fetch/update account profile |
| /api/feedback.php | POST | Submit feedback with sentiment |
| /api/oauth.php | GET | Placeholder for OAuth flows |

> Responses use JSON; PHP sessions track auth state. Extend with JWT or real OAuth when you wire a production backend.
