# Fitness Club (fitness_win11)

Lightweight demo web app intended to run under XAMPP (Apache + PHP + MySQL) placed in `htdocs/fitness_win11`.

Quick start
- Ensure XAMPP is installed and Apache + MySQL are running.
- Place this folder in your Apache `htdocs` (already in this workspace).
- Import the SQL schema: open `sql/database.sql` in phpMyAdmin or run from mysql client to create the `fitness_db` database and tables.
- Update DB credentials in `config/config.php` if your MySQL user/password differ (defaults to `root` with empty password on XAMPP).
- Visit http://localhost/fitness_win11/login.php to access the login page.

What I changed (quick changelog)
- `includes/header.php`: Fixed stray commented output and replaced a broken emoji with a proper label. This prevents accidental comment text appearing in the page.
- `assets/js/app.js`: Added defensive null checks around DOM access, switched several API calls to absolute paths (`/fitness_win11/api/...`), and improved error handling to avoid runtime exceptions when parts of the UI are missing.
- `assets/js/login.js`: Reworked login flow to guard against missing elements, exposed a safe `window.__fitnessRunBoot()` function for the boot animation, and switched API calls to absolute paths and included credentials. Fixed provider & signup handlers to use the exposed animation function.
- `api/feedback.php`: New endpoint that accepts JSON POSTs for feedback. Tries to insert into DB `feedback` table if available; otherwise appends to `data/feedback.log` as a fallback.

Notes & verification
- I ran PHP syntax checks (php -l) on modified files; no syntax errors were found.
- Because this is a local XAMPP app, please run the app in your local environment and exercise the flows (signup, login, account update, feedback) to verify runtime behavior and DB connectivity.

Home redesign (Sept 2025)
- Reworked `index.html` with a modular 12-column layout (left hero, center widgets, right utilities).
- New client-side features (demo-first, persisted to localStorage): rotating daily motivational quotes, environment-aware background, workout logging with toast feedback, class RSVP, emoji feedback, voice summary, font-size slider, and a simple sparkline for weekly calories.
- All new UI hooks are in `index.html` (IDs: `motivationQuote`, `logSetBtn`, `completeWorkoutBtn`, `caloriesSparkline`, `fontScale`, `voiceSummaryBtn`, `emojiFeedback`, and RSVP buttons `rsvp-btn`).

Next steps
- Add server-side endpoints to persist workouts and class RSVPs per authenticated user (suggested files: `api/workout.php`, `api/rsvp.php`).
- Run a WCAG contrast audit and refine color tokens for guaranteed compliance.
- Replace emoji placeholders with an adaptive SVG icon set for consistent theming.

Next recommended steps
- (Optional) Add CSRF protection to forms and API endpoints.
- (Optional) Create `feedback` DB table (if you want feedback to be stored in DB). Example:

  CREATE TABLE feedback (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NULL,
    feedback TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );

- (Optional) Run a JavaScript linter (ESLint) and fix any stylistic issues.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a simple PHPUnit or JS test harness for key flows.
- Create missing DB tables or update `sql/database.sql` to include `feedback` and `oauth_providers` tables.

Voting guidance: each member should nominate up to 2 roles they feel best fit. Run a ranked voting (1-5) per role and assign owners ensuring every member has at least two roles assigned.

Quick start
1. Copy this folder into your XAMPP htdocs: `f:\XAMMP\htdocs\fitness_win11`
2. Import the SQL in `sql/database.sql` into MySQL (phpMyAdmin or CLI).
3. Ensure `config/config.php` DB constants match your environment.
4. Start Apache & MySQL in XAMPP and open `http://localhost/fitness_win11/`.

Files of interest
- `index.html` - Windows 11-styled UI
- `assets/styles.css` - styles
- `assets/js/app.js` - UI and fetch calls to auth API
- `api/auth.php` - sign up / login / logout endpoints
- `config/config.php` - PDO DB connection and helpers
- `sql/database.sql` - database creation script

Notes & next steps
- This is a simulated starter project. For production use, enable HTTPS and implement OAuth flows.
- Add server-side input validation and stricter session handling.



How to run locally (quick)

1. Start the XAMPP Control Panel and ensure Apache (and MySQL if you need the DB) are running.
2. Visit the site in your browser: `http://localhost/fitness_win11/` (or `login.php` directly).
3. If you imported the SQL schema, ensure `config/config.php` has the correct DB credentials.

Smoke-test checklist

- Click main nav items to switch sections (Home, Membership, Booking, Shop, PowerZone, Feedback, Account).
- On small screens, click the hamburger menu (â˜°). It should open, close on item click, outside click, and Escape.
- Submit the Feedback form and verify a success or error message appears.
- If signed in, update account details and/or upload an avatar; confirm the AJAX success message.

If you want automated smoke tests (headless), reply "add automated tests" and I'll scaffold a minimal script.
